Web development is the process of creating websites. It includes the planning, designing, coding, testing, and maintenance of websites. Web developers use a variety of programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create websites that are both visually appealing and functional.

Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and back-end development. Front-end developers are responsible for the visual aspects of a website, such as the layout, design, and user interface. Back-end developers are responsible for the functionality of a website, such as the database, security, and server-side processing.

Web development is a rapidly growing field, and there is a high demand for skilled web developers. If you are interested in a career in web development, there are many resources available to help you learn the skills you need.

Here are some of the most popular programming languages for web development:

HTML: Hypertext Markup Language is the foundation of all web pages. It is used to define the structure and content of a web page.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is used to control the appearance of a web page. It can be used to change the font, color, and layout of text, as well as the size and position of images.
